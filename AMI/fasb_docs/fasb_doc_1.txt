Statement on Fair Value Measurement. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). An entity shall maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Subsequent measurement of certain financial instruments at fair value with changes recognized in other comprehensive income is required unless the practicability exception applies. The discount rate used in a present value technique should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use.
