Guidance on Business Combinations. The objective is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. The core principle requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date.

Goodwill shall be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The acquirer must subsequently measure goodwill for impairment. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights. Contingent consideration is an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control if specified future events occur or conditions are met. Such contingent consideration shall be measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
