Welcome to our Q3 2025 conference call. We are pleased to report strong execution despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our main focus remains on leading the transition to sustainable mobility. Development of our next-generation electric vehicle platform is on schedule. This new platform is designed to be completely carbon neutral throughout its lifecycle, from manufacturing to end-of-life recycling. The 'Stellara' model, our flagship battery electric sedan, saw a 15% increase in pre-orders this quarter.

We are also expanding our charging network. A robust charge infrastructure is essential for consumer confidence and mass adoption. We are partnering with municipal governments to install over 5,000 new fast charge stations by the end of next year. The ongoing debate around greenhouse gas emissions from transportation continues to validate our core strategy. We see a clear path to profitable growth while contributing positively to cleaner air. We are confident in our technology and our team.

We will now take your questions.

Operator: The first question is from Jane Smith at Tech Invest.

Jane Smith: Thanks for the details. Can you comment on the competitive landscape for autonomous vehicle technology? How does your advanced driver assistance system compare to peers, and what's your timeline for Level 4 autonomy?
