Eliza navigated the crowded marketplace, a river of sound and color. The air was thick with the scent of roasted almonds and a dozen different spices she couldn't name, mingling with the sweet perfume of fresh flowers from a nearby stall. A vendor to her left called out, holding up a string of brightly colored glass beads that shimmered in the afternoon sun. She shook her head with a smile and continued walking, her fingers brushing against the rough texture of a woven tapestry hanging from an awning.

The cobblestone street was uneven beneath her worn leather boots, a detail she had come to appreciate about the old city. Children darted between stands, their laughter echoing off the ancient stone walls. She paused at a stall piled high with citrus fruits, the vibrant oranges and yellows a stark contrast to the muted tones of the surrounding architecture. She bought a small bag of oranges, the weight a comforting presence in her hand as she rejoined the flow of the crowd, letting it carry her deeper into the heart of the city's oldest quarter, where a new discovery might await around any corner.
