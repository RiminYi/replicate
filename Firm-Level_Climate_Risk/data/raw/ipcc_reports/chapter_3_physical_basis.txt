The scientific evidence assessed in this chapter confirms that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred. The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. The global surface temperature was 1.09°C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with larger increases over land.

This observed warming is driven by emissions from human activities, with greenhouse gas warming partly masked by aerosol cooling. Projections indicate that continued global warm...ing will further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and the severity of wet and dry events. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased, a trend that is projected to continue. A warmer climate will intensify very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons, with implications for flooding or drought. The proportion of intense tropical cyclones is projected to increase at the global scale, and the continued sea level rise is inevitable.
