This chapter assesses mitigation pathways consistent with long-term goals. Limiting human-induced global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative carbon dioxide emissions, reaching at least net-zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades. Pathways limiting warming to 1.5Â°C with no or limited overshoot involve rapid and deep GHG emission reductions in all sectors.

The transition to a low-carbon economy requires a significant scaling-up of renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and wind energy. Policy instruments like a carbon tax or emission trading schemes are critical for creating economic incentives for this transition. Furthermore, energy efficient technologies and demand-side management are essential components of these mitigation strategies. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play a role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. International cooperation, such as that envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol and subsequent agreements, is fundamental for achieving ambitious climate goals and ensuring a just transition for all nations and communities involved in the process.
